No of requests timed out
No of requests dropped
Avg no of reqs in server queue
Avg no of reqs in each core queue
Avg response time = departure time - initial timestamp of request (only if departure happens)*
Avg Waiting time = time when incorequeue=true - initial timestamp
Avg Service time = time when incorequeue=false(set this during departure) - time when incorequeue=true
Avg CPU Utilization for each core = keep summing the time difference between isbusy=false to isbusy=true for each core. then divide by last departure timestamp to get fraction
Avg time spent in switching = put a counter in the switching done event handler, and in the end multiply by switching delay
Avg number of busy threads = after every event call a function calculate metrics - keep summing (time difference between prev event and this event)*(current no of busy threads). in the end divide by last departure timestamp
Time spent by each client on thinking (optional)

*Request timestamp is modified in code, create an initial requestId-timestamp dictionary and get the value from that if departure happens
